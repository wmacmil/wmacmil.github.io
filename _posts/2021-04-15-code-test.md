Let's talk about haskell. Here is some sample code. 

```haskell
a :: [Int]
a = [1..100]

b :: [Int]
b = [2..200]

c = a ++ b
```
By contrast, here is some ruby code.

Here's some attempted kramdown : 
$$ \frac{A \quad b}{c} $$
$$ \frac{\Gamma \vdash \quad b}{c} $$
$$ \frac{\Gamma \vdash b \quad \Gamma \vdash  b'}{c} $$
$$ \frac{\Gamma \vdash b \quad \Gamma \vdash  b'}{c}{d} $$
$$ \frac{\Gamma \vdash b \quad \Gamma \vdash  b'}{\frac{c}{d}} $$


Here's some attempted kramdown : $$2 + 2$$.

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
